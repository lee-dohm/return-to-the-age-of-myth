Information on a home grown superhero campaign setting for the [HERO game system][hero].

## Overview

The early 2020s were a time of great turmoil: multiple pandemics, climate change, political upheaval. When people were reaching their breaking point and all hope seemed lost, something happened as if by magic. Whatever element it was that went away as the modern age began, taking with it gods, demons, super-powerful heroes and villains, came back.

A new plague swept across the planet, sending thousands upon thousands of people into comas. Some of them, after awakening and recovering from the illness, found when trying to get their lives back to normal that they would never be so again.

## Character Creation

This will be a "standard" powered superheroic campaign according to the Hero 6E rules:

* **Total Points:** 400
* **Matching Complications:** 75
* **Max Points per Complication:** 40

I've never run a campaign with such a high power level before, so this is subject to change.
